# ArchiMate-Meta-Model
The ArchiMate Meta Model is extracted from ArchiMate 3 Specification. In the specification the meta model is describe by layers. Here I put them together in one single diagram and also add the connection between the layers. It covers the Motivation Layer, Strategy Layer, Business Layer, Application Layer and the Technology Layer.

Here are 2 diagrams. First diagram I use Archimate notations. It will help us to understand the basic archimate language structure.
Second Diagram I use only simple UML Class notation for all element, this is the normal way to create meta models. But I keep the archimate color schema of the elements in each layer to help understand the archimate core framework.
