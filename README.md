# ArchiMate-Meta-Model
The ArchiMate Meta Model is extracted from ArchiMate 3 Specification. In the specification the meta model is describe by layers. Here we put them together in one single diagram and also add the connection between the layers. It covers the Motivation Layer, Strategy Layer, Business Layer, Application Layer and the Technology Layer.

Here are 2 diagrams. Normally the meta model use only simple UML Class as the element notation. I also draw a diagram using Archimate notation to help understanding the Archimate language structure.
